# Portfolio Recommendation Runtime Error Fix

## Problem
Users were getting runtime errors when clicking "Generate Portfolio Recommendation":
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'risk_profile')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'risk_profile')
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The backend fallback function was returning a different data structure than the main endpoint
2. **Missing Null Checks**: The frontend component wasn't properly handling cases where data might be undefined or incomplete
3. **API Response Inconsistency**: The fallback endpoint used different field names (`portfolio_allocation` vs `allocation`, `investment_projections` vs `projections`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Component Safety (PortfolioRecommendation.tsx)
- Added proper null checks for `data` prop
- Made `data` prop optional in interface
- Added comprehensive validation for all required data fields
- Added debug logging to help identify issues

### 2. Frontend Service Validation (investmentPlannerService.ts)
- Added validation for API response data completeness
- Added fallback values for missing fields in risk_metrics
- Added validation for projections array
- Enhanced error handling in InvestmentPlanner component

### 3. Backend API Consistency (backend_api_with_agents.py)
- Fixed fallback function to return same data structure as main endpoint
- Changed field names from `portfolio_allocation` to `allocation`
- Changed field names from `investment_projections` to `projections`
- Added proper year 0 entry in projections
- Added proper SIP handling in fallback function
- Added consistent summary structure with all required fields

### 4. Data Structure Standardization
Ensured both main and fallback endpoints return:
```json
{
  "allocation": { "sp500": 40, "bonds": 25, ... },
  "projections": [{ "year": 0, "portfolio_value": 100000, ... }],
  "risk_metrics": { "expected_return": 12, "volatility": 15, "sharpe_ratio": 0.8 },
  "summary": {
    "initial_investment": 100000,
    "final_value": 250000,
    "total_return": 150000,
    "investment_type": "lumpsum",
    "tenure_years": 10,
    "risk_profile": "Moderate"
  }
}
```

## Testing
Created `test_api_response.py` to verify API response structure and field presence.

## Expected Outcome
- No more runtime errors when generating portfolio recommendations
- Consistent data structure regardless of whether ML models are available
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Proper fallback behavior when API calls fail
